# Whoami
I'm a cybersecurity professional with over a decade of experience in IT, but I'm specialized in Application Security and penetration testing. I’m highly adaptable, deeply technical, and solutions-oriented, approaching challenges with an engineering mindset to deliver practical and effective outcomes.

My achievements include building a scalable AppSec program from the ground up, integrating SAST, DAST, SCA, IAST, and secret scanning tools into the SDLC and CI/CD pipelines. I’ve also selected and implemented the STRIDE threat modeling methodology, curated and deployed tailored training videos for developers, and established a Security Champions program to promote a security-focused culture. Additionally, I bring experience in risk rating and using data-driven metrics to align technical efforts with organizational goals.

I have extensive experience performing penetration tests on various types of web applications, APIs, in diverse environments - including cloud-native and hybrid architectures. I administrate the Cloudflare WAF and have experience working in AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud environments. I hold eWPT and eCPPT certifications and am pursuing the HackTricks AWS Red Team Expert certification to deepen my expertise in cloud security.

Outside of work, I co-lead the OWASP Cleveland Chapter, sharing knowledge with the security community through workshops and discussions. I’m also interested in malware analysis and reverse engineering and am currently working toward the TCM Security Practical Malware Research Professional certification. Lastly, I've disclosed two CVEs on an open source application while doing security research in my free time.
